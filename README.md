# Day-Planner

2/28/23

The purpose of this program is to create a work day planner that keeps the user on track with a color change function at the turn of each hour. It will also store any inputs in each of the text boxes to be brought out on openning the application.

One of our TAs Kathryn Vincent helped me build the functionality to save and load information to the text input area on lines 60-80 of my script.js file.
